# Overview -- WIP
PantryPal is a an application that provides users the ability to find recipes based on the ingredients already in their pantry. Users will be able to enter ingredients into the search bar and find recipes based on those ingredients. Additionally, after trying those recipes a user will be able to provide a rating for others to view. 

## Data Structure:

### recipes_1
For **recipe_1** I went with a dictionary. The recipe values corresponded with a specific key. The only data type that is able to handle key-value pairs is a dictionary. I also used a list to define the values associated with the *Ingredients* key. 

### all_recipes
For **all_recipes** I went with a list. It was mentioned that this structure should be in sequential order. With this in mind a list, which is ordered, is the best data structure choice.
